	Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Objective-C Foundation Tool Bundle adds a few features to the 
TextMate editor for Mac OS X that I needed at one point during my 
attempts to learn the language. I became annoyed with constantly
adding plaintext documents, then typing in the required template.
Using the included templates required just as much editing as 
starting from scratch. 

This bundle has been tested on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.1, which 
shouldn't matter anyways. The version of TextMate I use as of this
writing is TextMate v1.5.9 (1510).

I currently have this bundle distributed via GitHub at:

		http://github.com/uxp/Objective-C-Foundation-Tool.tmbundle
		
Or Packaged at:
